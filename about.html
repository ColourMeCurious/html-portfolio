<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My name is Niocle. I am a mum of 3 and the wife to a wonderful husband. I consider myself to be a creative person who is also incredibly curious and loves to learn new things</p>

<p>My latest adventure is to learn web developing and everything i possibly can about ther internet and game and app development. My goal in this persuit of knowldge is to create games and apps to help children with learning disabilities to read, write and do math, in ways that are more suited to their learning capabilities.</p>

<p>I believe that everychild is capable of learning, it.s just that some of them have their own unique way of doing so. My quest is to find those ways and help these children reach their greatest potential.</p>
